# Design Patterns

## This repository has a lot of small projects that implements some of the design patterns that i know. Here's a quick resume of then:


- [Factory Method](https://github.com/Mavicico/padroesDeProjeto/tree/main/FactoryMethod)

  - This project make different types of sandwiches without direct object construction calls. Instead, the project calls a factory that return the sandwiches according with the ordering. By doing that, this project respect the Single Responsibility Principle and the Open/Closed Principle.
  
- [Abstract Factory](https://github.com/Mavicico/padroesDeProjeto/tree/main/AbstractFactory) 
  
  - This is basically a evolution of the previous project, where milkshakes are added and now the orders are combos: you can order a combo that comes with specific types of milkshakes and sandwiches. This project still respects the SRP and the OCP.
